### Introduction:
Uber Eats, star-ship, and other apps providing easily-accessed food are pushing UCLA students away from going into kitchens. Many students find it hard to begin learning cooking and feel confused with all the thick, complex recipe books in stores. Our team plans to make a simple recipe website to enhance UCLA studentsâ€™ will and ability to cook. 


### How to Run the Project Locally?

Clone the project from GitHub:
git clone https://github.com/Sterile-Neutrino/recipe-website-project.git
cd recipe-website-project/server
npm install
node index.js
Now the backend is running at http://localhost:4000
Keep the backend running, and open a second terminal session
cd recipe-website-project/client
npm install
npm start
Now the web app will start on http://localhost:3000
To view the intended styling, open the web app with Google Chrome, maximized window.
